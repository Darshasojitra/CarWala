ðŸš—The dealership wants a system that can predict car sales and other important numbers (KPIs) for the next 3 months using old sales data. This will help them plan their budget better. The system should also show how these numbers are connected to each other, for example, how profit changes if the number of cars sold changes.


ðŸŽ¯Goal: Predict car sales and other KPIs for the next 3 months.

ðŸ“‘Data: Monthly data for each KPI (account_id, english_name, dealer_code, year, month, monthly_value, yearly_value).

ðŸ‘‰Prediction: Build a system to predict the next 3 months' values for all KPIs.

ðŸ”—Correlation: Show how different KPIs affect each other; add a feature where changing one KPI updates related KPIs automatically.

ðŸ‘€Visualization: Show results in interactive charts and dashboards.
